# Mattermost Handbook Scraping Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the approach to scrape the Mattermost handbook content while respecting rate limits and ensuring comprehensive data collection.

## Components

### 1. Scraping Infrastructure
- Create a proxy rotation system to distribute requests
- Implement delay mechanisms between requests
- Use a queue system for managing requests

### 2. Data Collection Strategy
- Start with the main handbook URL
- Extract and store all links for recursive processing
- Parse and store content from each page
- Handle different content types (text, tables, images)

### 3. Rate Limiting Prevention
- Implement exponential backoff
- Rotate between multiple proxy servers
- Add random delays between requests (2-5 seconds)
- Monitor response headers for rate limit information
- Cache successful responses

### 4. Content Processing
- Extract main content from each page
- Process and clean HTML content
- Handle internal links and references
- Store metadata (last updated, authors, etc.)

### 5. Storage System
- Use a database to store:
  - Page content
  - URLs and their relationships
  - Metadata
  - Scraping status
- Implement resume capability for interrupted scraping

### 6. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure
1. Set up proxy rotation system
2. Create base scraper with rate limiting
3. Implement storage system

#### Phase 2: Content Collection
1. Develop main content extractor
2. Implement link discovery
3. Create content processor

#### Phase 3: Robustness
1. Add error handling
2. Implement retry mechanism
3. Add monitoring and logging

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- Node.js for scraping logic
- Express for API endpoints
- Puppeteer for JavaScript-rendered content
- Cheerio for HTML parsing
- MongoDB for storage

### Infrastructure
- Proxy rotation service
- Rate limiting middleware
- Queue system for requests

## Error Handling
- Implement retry mechanism for failed requests
- Log all errors with context
- Store failed URLs for later processing
- Monitor system health

## Monitoring
- Track successful/failed requests
- Monitor rate limit status
- Log processing times
- Track content coverage

## Success Metrics
- Complete handbook content collection
- No rate limit violations
- All internal links processed
- Clean, structured content storage

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Implement proxy rotation system
3. Create basic scraper with rate limiting
4. Develop storage system
5. Add content processing
6. Implement monitoring
7. Test and refine
